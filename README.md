# MARVEL
## Introduction
* This is the code repository for the paper "Multi-Robot Reliable Navigation in Uncertain Topological Environments with Graph Attention Networks" that was submitted to RA-L 2024. The demo video is also uploaded `MARVEL_Demo.mp4`. 
* This is a joint research program of A*STAR and NUS. (Â© 2024 A\*STAR. All rights reserved.)
## Dataset
Benchmark experiments are conducted on a series of canonical transportation networks, namely Sioux Falls Network, Friedrichshain, Anaheim, and Winnipeg.

Before you try to run the codes, please download the dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12L7PRDGWPF-S6sz-tFMFgfeBZWwQwVaV/view. Then put them into the folder `Networks` .
## MARVEL Algorithm
### Dependencies 
* Python 3.8
* pandas
* random
* gensim
* NetworkX
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* PyTorch
* PyTorch Geometric (PyG)
* wandb (optional)
### Description
* We integrate our simulation for MARVEL into the training and test processing. 
* `Embedding.py`:Implements the graph embedding process to generate node features for the robot navigation environment.
* `Env.py`:Constructs the environment, including robot operation and observation processes, defining different topological graph structures
* `GAT.py`: Implements the policy network based on Graph Attention Networks (GAT), integrating success rate changes during training to enhance adaptability and decision-making capabilities in different environments.
* `main.py`: Manages the training process, including all parameter settings such as the map used, training iterations, and optimizer configurations.
* `Test.py`: Tests the final trained MARVEL model and calculates the overall success rate for evaluation.
### Usage
```bash
cd MARVEL
# training. you can config the parameters in main.py
python main.py
# testing.  use your own model by -m /path/to/your/model.pth .
python Test.py
```
